## Requires 
- Metamask
- Truffle
- Ganache
- NodeJS

## How To Run

### ethereumjs-testrpc

In a console

cd \rock-paper-sizz\

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node -v`
### `npm -v`

If either of these commands go unrecognized, visit Nodejs.org and download the appropriate installer. Run it through all of the default options.
Once finished, close and reload your console and re-run the commands above. They should now provide you with version numbers.
Next, let's use NPM to install the Ethereumjs-testrpc:

### `npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

Once finished, run the following command to start it:

### `testrpc`

This provides you with 10 different accounts and private keys, along with a local server at localhost:8545.

Leave this window open!

### How to Test the Solidy code using Truffle (Optional)

cd \rock-paper-sizz\
truffle.cmd compile
truffle.cmd migrate 
truffle.cmd test
